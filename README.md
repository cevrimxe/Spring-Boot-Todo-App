## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that the following tools are installed on your system:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 17 or higher.
- **Maven**: For managing dependencies and building the project.
- **Git**: To clone the repository.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cevrimxe/Spring-Boot-Todo-App.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd Spring-Boot-Todo-App
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Run Maven to download all necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

### Running the Application

Start the application with the following command:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Once the application is running, open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8081
```

### Alternative Way to Run the Application

If you prefer not to use Maven directly, you can run the application using the prebuilt **JAR file** and a **BAT file**:

1. **Download the JAR and BAT Files**:
   - [Download JAR](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18M0Z06qWJEnYlXzm4EJfqCLOuKxapmfF/view?usp=sharing)
   - [Download BAT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fDT6kT-3s9K1buYfHMoK5DHaFRFR-Q-Y/view?usp=sharing)

2. **Place the Files Together**:
   Ensure the `.jar` file and the `.bat` file are in the same directory.

3. **Run the BAT File**:
   Double-click the `.bat` file to start the application.

   The BAT file internally runs the following command:
   ```
   java -jar spring-boot-todo-app.jar
   ```
